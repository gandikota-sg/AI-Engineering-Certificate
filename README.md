## Individual Courses

1. [Machine Learning with Python](https://github.com/gandikota-sg/AI-Engineering-Certificate/tree/main/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Python)
   
        Utilizes Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression,
          and SVM with a rainfall dataset to predict conditions
   
2. [Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras](https://github.com/gandikota-sg/AI-Engineering-Certificate/tree/main/Introduction%20to%20Deep%20Learning%20and%20Neural%20Networks%20with%20Keras)

         A. Build a baseline model with the Keras library to build a neural network with the following:
            - One hidden layer of 10 nodes, and a ReLU activation function
            - Use the adam optimizer and the mean squared error  as the loss function.
   
            1. Randomly split the data into a training and test sets by holding 30% of the data for testing.
            2. Train the model on the training data using 50 epochs.
            3. Evaluate the model and compute MSE between predicted concrete strength and the actual concrete strength.
            4. Repeat steps 1 - 3, 50 times, i.e., create a list of 50 mean squared errors.
            5. Report the mean and the standard deviation of the mean squared errors.
         B. Repeat Part A but use a normalized version of the data.
         C. Repeat Part B but use 100 epochs this time for training.
         D. Repeat part B but use a neural network with the following instead:
            - Three hidden layers, each of 10 nodes and ReLU activation function.
      
3. [Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing](https://github.com/gandikota-sg/AI-Engineering-Certificate/tree/main/Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Vision%20and%20Image%20Processing)

       Loads the training images, creates features, and trains the model
   
       Given an image of a stop sign in CV Studio, the image classifier will
          classify and report accuracy it predicts it is correct
   
4. [Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch]

       The course will start with Pytorch's  tensors and Automatic differentiation package.
   
       Then each section will cover different models starting off with fundamentals like feedforward deep neural networks,
           the role of different activation functions, normalization and dropout layers.
   
       Then Convolutional Neural Networks, transfer learning, and several other deep learning methods were covered.
   
5. [Building Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow]
      
        Utilizes TensorFlow library to apply deep learning to different data types in order to solve real world problems
   
6. [AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning](https://github.com/gandikota-sg/AI-Engineering-Certificate/blob/main/ResNet18.ipynb)
     
       Utilizes an image classifier using the ResNet18 pre-trained model
         to identify cracks in IBM Watson
